# Unit Testing Examples

This repo contains an example of unit testing in Python. The tests and the
library they test are both incomplete, see if you can finish them. Try Test
Driven Development (TDD), see how it works for you.

To run the tests on the command line:

```
python3 -m unittest linked_list_test.py
```
